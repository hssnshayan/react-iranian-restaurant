# An Iranian Restaurant React app

This is a very simple and fun project with **ReactJS** library. This project is all with basic React hooks and concept and may improve later.

It's worth mentioning that this project is based on a section from [React Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/?couponCode=D_0722) with dear [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://github.com/maxschwarzmueller).
